# Protein-ID---Down-Syndrome-Mice-Learning
An attempt at replicating the 2015 paper “Self-Organizing Feature Maps Identify Proteins Critical to Learning in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome,” using a combination of non-linear dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering. The authors of the original paper have used self-organizing feature maps (SOM).

## Description
A 2015 paper by Clara Higuera et al aimed to find proteins relevant to learning disabilities induced by Down Syndrome in mice using Self Organizing Maps (SOM). A secondary goal included studying the effects of memantine (a drug for ) on said proteins in mice.*

In my project I tried to replicate the findings of this study by using different methods including spectral clustering, fuzzy clustering and DBSCAN.

For a detailed summary of my methods and results, please refer to the file Kapse_Gauri_Project.pdf

*The goal is not to determine if memantine helps rescue impaired learning. This has already been established. The authors of the original paper were rather looking for the mechanism by which memantine rescues learning (which proteins it acts on).
